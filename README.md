# 🌍 Global Warming Potential Prediction Platform

A Flask-based web platform that predicts the **Global Warming Potential (GWP)** of chemical compounds using advanced **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**. The system supports multiple prediction models for **GWP20**, **GWP100**, and **GWP500** time horizons, and features seamless molecule visualization through **Ketcher**.

---

## 🚀 Features

* **🔬 GWP Prediction Models**
  Predict GWP values using three pre-trained GNN architectures:

  * **MPNN (Message Passing Neural Network)**
  * **Neural Fingerprint (NF)**
  * **Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)**

* **🧪 SMILES Input Support**
  Input SMILES strings manually, or use the integrated **Ketcher** molecule editor to draw molecules.

* **🌐 Interactive Web Interface**

  * Built with **Flask** and styled using **Tailwind CSS**
  * Responsive UI with model selection and prediction history
  * Integration with **SweetAlert2** for user-friendly alerts

* **🧠 Model Inference**
  Powered by **PyTorch**, **DGL**, and **dgllife** for efficient molecular graph handling and inference.
